 *   - scoped to a foreign school id → zero rows,
 *   - unscoped (GUC never set)      → zero rows.
 *
 * Tenant tables are discovered dynamically (every `public` table with a `school_id`
 * column and FORCE RLS), so a newly-added tenant table is covered automatically — a
 * table that ships without the isolation policy makes this test fail loudly.

 * isolation — and every legitimate seed that adds a row (INCR-21's two MATRON assignments, a new
 * academic period) turns this script permanently red, at which point a real isolation regression
 * hides among the standing failures. Isolation itself is proven by the two directions below, which
 * stay EXACT: a foreign school id and an unset GUC must both return ZERO. A widened policy
 * (`USING (true)`, a dropped tenant_isolation, a table shipped without FORCE) shows up there —
 * verified by breaking one on purpose and watching this script go red.
